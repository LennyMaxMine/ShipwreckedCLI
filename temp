Dear Shipwrecked Team,

Our son Lenny is incredibly excited to have been invited to attend Shipwrecked – thank you so much for this wonderful opportunity!

We already participated in the parent call, which was very helpful, but we still have a few follow-up questions. Due to the long journey back to Germany, Lenny would prefer to fly home on August 12th instead of directly after the event. He is currently working hard to earn the required Shells for the post-event hotel stay.

Will the participants be checked into the hotel and supervised by your team after the official end of the program? Lenny’s return flight is scheduled for 4 PM on August 12th, 2025.

He already has a valid ESTA visa, which was originally issued for the Neighborhood project in San Francisco. Can he use the same ESTA for Shipwrecked, or would he need a separate one or a formal invitation letter from your side?

We would love to book the flight today to avoid rising prices and would appreciate a brief confirmation.

Thank you again for making this experience possible for Lenny – we truly appreciate it!

Warm regards,
Katja
